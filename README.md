Graduate informatics student at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/about) persuing a M.Sc. in Interaction Design, Game and Learning Technology.

I am interested in
* Graphics (notably path tracing, voxels and color perception)
* Programming Languages and Metaprogramming
* Physical Modelling of Instruments and Room Acoustics

Some notable projects I have worked on
* [FFI Middleware](https://github.com/Kurumiiw/Middleware):<br>bachelors thesis in collaboration with the Norwegian Defence Force Research Establishment<br> on ways of mitigating problems with traditional TCP based communication over<br>military networks.
* [6502 Macroprocessor](https://github.com/hackerspace-ntnu/6502-macroprocessor):<br>an educational project aimed at making a replica of a 6502 microprocessor on breadboard.
* [sim86](https://github.com/Soimn/sim86):<br>rough first pass of a full 8086 decoder and partial simulator for [Computer Enhance](https://www.computerenhance.com/) course work.
* [illum](https://github.com/Soimn/illum):<br>clean up of [course project](https://github.com/Soimn/TDT4230-Project) in graphics on path traced caustics with dispersion.<br>Current version supports only static spheres and non-dispersive refraction, but dispersion and a<br>Metropolis Light Transport like scheme is planned.
* [norse6502](https://github.com/Soimn/norse6502):<br>rewrite of [visual6502](https://github.com/trebonian/visual6502) in the programming language odin to allow programmatic extraction<br>of the 6502 random control logic.
* [rin](https://github.com/Soimn/rin:<br>exploration of different designs for a compiler
